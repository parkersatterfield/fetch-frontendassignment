# Fetch Rewards Sign Up Form
![Fetch Logo](./src/logo.png)

## About
This project is set up using React (initialized via create-react-app) with Bootstrap linked as a class library. I used an open source package, bcrypt, to hash passwords before sending them through the provided endpoint on form submit, and basic fetch calls to grab the occupation and state data. The state and occupation data was then dynamically rendered as select option tags for their respective dropdown elements.
